## PERTURBATION EXPANSION
### Written by Hantao Zhang, Dong Bai and Zhongzhou Ren
For specific applications of the Coulomb-corrected BERW formula with perturbation expansion to evaluate the  scattering phase shifts of charged particles in a harmonic oscillator trap can be  seen in the
two papers above

# Phase Shift Calculation with VEGAS Monte Carlo Integration

This program calculates quantum mechanical phase shifts using perturbation expansion up to 12th order, implemented with the VEGAS Monte Carlo integration algorithm.

## 1. Installation

### Required Packages
```bash
pip install vegas==6.2.1 
```

## 2. Physical Constants
Constants are defined in common units (MeV and fm), if you want to change these constants, please directly modify them in the config.py file


## 3. Green's functions and their limitations at r ->0 
Please note that we have rigorously handled the limits of the Green's functions GC0 (Coulomb Green's funtion) and GHO (harmonic  oscillator Green's function) as r approaches zero, with the analytical results defined limitGC0 and limitGHO

## 4. Integration Parameters

|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `rmax1`     | 1e3 fm | Upper limit for 1st-order (quad)     |
| `rmax`      | 1e2 fm | Upper limit for 2â€“12th orders (VEGAS) |
| `nitn`      | 20     | VEGAS adaptive iterations            |
| `nevalvalue`| 1e4    | Function evaluations per iteration (sampling points)   |
